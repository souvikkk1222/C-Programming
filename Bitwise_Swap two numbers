Write a program to swap two integers using only the bitwise XOR operator without using a temporary variable.
The program should take two integers, A and B, as input and output the swapped values.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer A
The second line contains an integer B
Constraints

(-10^5 ≤ A ≤ 10^5)
(-10^5 ≤ B ≤ 10^5)
Output Format

The first line contains the swapped value of A.
The second line contains the swapped value of B.
Sample Input 0

5
10
Sample Output 0

-7

CODE:------

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int A, B;

  
    scanf("%d", &A);
    scanf("%d", &B);

  
    A = A ^ B;
    B = A ^ B;
    A = A ^ B;

    printf("%d\n%d\n", A, B);

    return 0;
